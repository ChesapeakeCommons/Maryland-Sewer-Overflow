# Maryland-Sewer-Overflow
The Maryland Reported Sewer Overflow Database contains bypasses, combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) from January 2005 through the most recent update. MDE updates this database regularly. Although MDE requires that all public sewer system owners or operators report overflows to us, there may be incidents that were not reported. Note that overflow amounts provided by the person reporting the overflow may be estimated using best professional judgment or they may be actual readings from flow measurement devices when available.
